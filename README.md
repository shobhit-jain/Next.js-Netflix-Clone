### Branching workflow

- Always branch out from development
- If you're working on a new feature, prefix your branch name with `feature/`. Example: `feature/auth`.
- If you're fixing a bug, prefix your branch name `bugfix/`. Example: `bugfix/auth-fixing`.
- Once you're done working on your branch, make a pull request back to development.
- After your PR is merged and you're sure everything works as expected, you can make a PR to `main` from `development`. ðŸŽ‰
