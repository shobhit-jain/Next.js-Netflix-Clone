Web frontend for Next.js - Netflix-Clone | powered by React.js

---

## Local development

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js > 10.13 (Recommended to install it using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script))
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (For this project we will use yarn as a package manager)

## Setup

- Install dependencies
  - `yarn`
- Create local `.env.local` file
- Start local server
  - `yarn dev`

## Development

### Branching workflow

- Always branch out from development
- If you're working on a new feature, prefix your branch name with `feature/`. Example: `feature/auth`.
- If you're fixing a bug, prefix your branch name `bugfix/`. Example: `bugfix/phone-number-formatting`.
- Once you're done working on your branch, make a pull request back to development.
- After your PR is merged and you're sure everything works as expected, you can make a PR to `main` from `development`. ðŸŽ‰
